##smartparking 
With the growing number of cars on the road, several challenges are becoming increasingly apparent. Many individuals are finding it difficult to secure satisfactory parking, while others struggle to park their vehicles efficiently. To mitigate these issues, engineers have been working on innovative solutions.

This project presents a smart parking system designed to streamline the parking process. The smart parking application serves as a guide for drivers looking to find suitable parking spots. It displays the number of available spaces in parking areas registered with the application, which are shown on a Google map. The parking facilities are equipped with an infrastructure that detects the number of empty spots.

The application also includes a feature to control the movements of a prototype car in four directions, guiding it to the desired parking spot. The car model is capable of parking itself automatically through an auto-park option in the app. This auto-parking functionality is made possible by a combination of components, including an Arduino, reed switch, ultrasonic sensors, and DC motors. The reed switch detects the presence of parking spaces, and the ultrasonic sensors on both sides take precise measurements to identify the optimal spot. If no suitable space is available, the car model continues moving forward in search of one.

The system offers several ##key features:

Real-Time Parking Information: Displays the number of available parking spots on a Google map.
Auto-Parking Capability: The prototype car can be instructed to park itself automatically using the app.
Advanced Sensor Integration: Combines Arduino, reed switches, ultrasonic sensors, and DC motors to detect parking spaces and control the car's movements.
This project not only showcases my expertise in developing practical solutions but also illustrates my ability to integrate technology with real-world applications to tackle common urban challenges.
